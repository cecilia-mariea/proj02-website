        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/fig1_new.png" alt="Carbon Emissions Related Economic Investments Decreasing Across Developing and Emerging Countries" />
          <figcaption>Mean CO2 emissions in metric tons per $1M USD due to emissions-related loans, normalized to a value of 100 in 2015, compared across emerging and developed countries from 2015 to 2018.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Grouping countries by development level, using the average as the aggregation method. Removes visual clutter, but still tells retains interesting context of the countries.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: -1.5</b></li>
              <li>Grouping data points by development level is dishonest because there isn't even an equal or fair way to sample emerging, developing, and developed countries from the actual population of countries, let alone represent it using just the countries from this dataset. This is already a convenience sample, and grouping it by an uneven metric definitely is not representative of actual trends. Additionally, even if this were a good sample of countries, aggregating by means without utilizing markers of deviations removes variations within the group and hides much of the truth from the viewer.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Using normalized values (values at 2015 = 100) and only representing cleaned data from the 2015-2018 subset.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: -1</b></li>
              <li>Normalization to an internal datapoint has utility in time trend data, but an artificial 'ceiling' is created by the subset. An artificial start year of 2015 is also created by starting from where the recorded data was normalized, but it is also a decent solution to solve the issue of some data being MAR by year.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Truncating the y-axis to start 87.5.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: -2</b></li>
              <li> Makes the decreasing trend sharper, dramaticizing it to the viewer. There were also values from before 2015 that might be below this 87.5 minimum, but in order to present a misleading narrative that emphasizes the decline, these values are effectively ignored twice-over.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Using a line plot to represent time-series data. Using annotations to quantify the exact percentage of decrease from start to finish.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: 2</b> </li>
              <li>There is no distortion of the data, and the annotations provide additional clarity that might not be obvious at first. The reader does less visual work to quantify the differences using spacial context.</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <img src="./images/fig2_new.png" alt="Carbon Emissions Related Economic Investments Increasing Across Key Emerging Economies" />
          <figcaption>Raw CO2 emissions in metric tons per $1M USD due to emissions-related loans, compared across top emitting countries (Kazakhstan, Philippines, Türkiye, Indonesia, Tunisia) from 2015 to 2018.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Using non-normalized emission intensities to reveal increasing carbon footprints without comparing to any set levels.</li>
            <ul> 
              <li> <b>Score: 2</b> </li>
              <li> Visualizes absolute values, rather than ratios that often abstract away the impact of the data from the viewer.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Use per country values, without grouping.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: 2</b> </li>
              <li> Retains  within group variation, removing artificial smoothing.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Only represent a subset of countries present in the dataset.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: -1</b> </li>
              <li> visual clutter, but cherry picks data to emphasize increasing trends.</li>
            </ul>
          <li> Use annotations to quantify increased carbon footprint to emphasize increasing emissions. </li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Score: 2</b> </li>
              <li>Provides clarity of the differences that are being represented. This is especially useful for the bottom four countries of the top 5 emitters since they are closely grouped.</li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          Designing these two visualizations with a per-country, time-based dataset made clear the impact of groupings, cherry-picking, aggregating, internal normalization, and axes truncation on earnest representations. Line plots to visualize time-series data and annotating the quantity of change were straightforward decisions. They were made simply to help viewers interpret the data without distortion. Other decisions required more involved decisions making. Grouping countries initially seems like a useful way to concisely tell a particular story, but it's clear that suppressing within-group variation is deceiving. It was initially difficult to find a grouping to support our proposition since carbon emissions are generally increasing accros all impact factors. We also initially tried grouping by regions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It was unsurprising how easy it was to make deciving design decisions with data that was normalized or sparse. However, it was surprising how difficult it was to make these decisions not immediately obvious. Although, the line between being clear and inearnest is not always explicit. There must be a responsiblity to represent the datasets without introducing artifacts. Simultaneously, persuasion is not inherently unethical, like encodings to guide the viewers attention. Once design decisions stop being made to increase a viewer's understanding and start being made to exaggerate drama or be convenient, unethical design begins.
